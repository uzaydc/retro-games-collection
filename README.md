# Classic Retro Games Collection (C++)

This repository contains a diverse collection of classic arcade and logic games implemented in C++. 
It serves as a technical portfolio demonstrating fundamental programming concepts, real-time logic and algorithmic problem-solving.

## 🕹️ Games in the Collection

* **asteroid.cpp:** Physics-based space shooter with collision detection.
* **blokyerlestirme-tetris.cpp:** Tetris mechanics using rotation matrices and line-clearing.
* **bulmaca.cpp / bulmacaiki.cpp / puzzle.cpp:** Sliding puzzle logic and pattern recognition.
* **jewels.cpp:** Match-three logic and grid-based state management.
* **mayintarlasi.cpp / mayintarlasi2.cpp:** Recursive grid-clearing and proximity logic.
* **race.cpp / yaris2.cpp:** Top-down racing with obstacle avoidance and scrolling.
* **satranc.cpp:** Chess engine logic and move validation.
* **snake-yilan.cpp / snakehunt.cpp:** Coordinate-based movement and growth mechanics.
* **tron.cpp:** Real-time competitive movement and trail collision.
* **voleybol.cpp:** Ball trajectory physics and character control logic.
* **xonixalan.cpp:** Area-capture algorithms based on boundary detection.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

* **Algorithm Design:** Developed logic-heavy systems, including pathfinding, recursive grid-clearing, and collision matrices.
* **Memory Management:** Focused on efficient resource utilization using C++ pointers and memory safety principles.
* **Data Structures:** Utilized 2D arrays, vectors, and custom objects to manage game environments and entity states.
* **Physics & Mathematics:** Applied 2D coordinate geometry, velocity vectors, and AABB collision detection.
* **State Management:** Implemented robust game loops to synchronize input processing, logic updates, and rendering cycles.
  
## 🚀 How to Run

1. Compile any .cpp file using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++ game_name.cpp -o game).
2. Run the generated executable.
